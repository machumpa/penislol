# Chewey Bot Api

This is a handler for the Chewey Bot API. The API currently has random space,cats,dogs,birbs and many more to come as well as many more non image features to happen



Demo
```
var cheweyBot=require('cheweybot-api')
cheweyBot.init("MY-TOKEN")
// Some delay
cheweyBot.get("cat").then((reply)=>{
    console.log(reply.data); //Now have image url
})
```

```
var cheweyBot=require('cheweybot-api')

cheweyBot.init("MY-TOKEN").then((reply)=>{console.log(reply);
cheweyBot.get("cat").then((reply)=>{console.log(reply);})
})

setTimeout(()=>{
cheweyBot.show((data)=>{console.log(data);})
},200)
```

You can view all endpoints and a simple break down in .show\(\) and then also fetch any of the valid endpoints with .get



This library supports both promise and callback style referencing so use which every you prefer
